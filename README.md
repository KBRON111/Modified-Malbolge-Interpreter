# Modified-Malbolge-Interpreter
The C Malbolge interpreter with a couple modifications to help debugging.

The command lines accepted are as follows:

MalaInt.exe {mal program path} {normalization path} {memory dump path}

You need to at least add the path of the malabolge program. Currently if you want to dump memory you need to also normalize...sorry!
